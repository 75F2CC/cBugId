Notes:
* The BugId can now include the number of overwritten bytes, and a hash of
  their values if you supply a dxBugIdConfig["uHeapCorruptedBytesHashChars"]
  setting value of 1 or more. This can be useful when you want to detect if
  two instances of heap corruption wrote the same data to corrupt the heap.
  When enabled, a string with format "~L:H" is added to the BugId, where "L" is
  the length of the corruption and "H" is the hash. Note that L is not
  influenced by dxBugIdConfig["uArchitectureIndependentBugIdBits"], so BugId's
  created using this feature on x86 and x64 versions of an application may
  differ.
* You can now specify which version of cdb (x86 or x64) you want BugId to use.
  This can improve results when you use the x86 cdb to debug x86 applications:
  using the x64 cdb may prevent BugId from collecting page heap information.

API changes:
* cCdbWrapper has a new first argument "sCdbISA" inserted before the existing
  arguments. This argument indicates which version of cdb to use (x86 or x64,
  default depends on the OS ISA).
* Added dxBugIdConfig["uHeapCorruptedBytesHashChars"] (see above).

Bug fixes and improvements:
* Better handling of some OOM cases
* Better handling of failure to match symbol to address while generating
  assembly HTML
* Better handling of some STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN cases
* Show values of overwritten bytes in cases where heap corruption occurs.
* cStackFrame objects now have an oPreviousFrame property, which is set to the
  frame that is lower in number (i.e. the frame that was called from this
  frame).
* The sCdbISA argument to cCdbWrapper makes it easier to run x86 tests on x64
  OS-es, so these have been re-enabled.
* FastFail:AppExit was not reported as a potential security issue, but since
  it can be triggered by a R6025 pure virtual function call, it can be and the
  description now reflects this.
* The code could make excessive calls to fApplicationRunningCallback, this has
  been fixed.
